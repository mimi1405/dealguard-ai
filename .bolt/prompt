For all designs I ask you to make, have them be beautiful, not cookie cutter.
Make webpages that are fully featured and worthy for production use.

====================================
NEXT.JS / REACT RULES
====================================

- This project uses Next.js App Router.
- Components are Server Components by default.
- When using client-side hooks (useState, useEffect, useRef, etc),
  ALWAYS add "use client" at the very top of the file.

- Do NOT write code that triggers hydration mismatch errors such as:
  "Warning: Extra attributes from the server: class, style"

- Do NOT mix server-only logic into client components.

====================================
UI / DESIGN SYSTEM
====================================

- Use Tailwind CSS for styling.
- Use shadcn/ui for all UI primitives.
- Use lucide-react for icons.
- Do NOT install or use other UI libraries unless explicitly requested.

- Prefer clean layouts, strong hierarchy, and subtle animations.
- Default to dark theme when appropriate.

====================================
SECURITY & SERVER-SIDE RULES (CRITICAL)
====================================

- API keys, secrets, and tokens MUST NEVER be exposed to the client.
- Any integration with external APIs (e.g. MindStudio) MUST be implemented server-side only:
  - Next.js Route Handlers
  - Server Actions
  - Edge Functions (Supabase)

- The client may only call internal API routes.

====================================
SUPABASE RULES
====================================

- Supabase Auth is used for authentication.
- All protected routes MUST verify an active session.
- Row Level Security (RLS) MUST be enforced.
- Database access must always respect auth.uid().

====================================
FILE HANDLING & PREPROCESSING
====================================

- Users may upload PDFs only.
- Uploaded PDFs MUST be converted to text.
- Only extracted text artifacts (txt/md) may be sent to external AI services.
- Enforce a strict 10MB limit on any file sent to external services.
- Original files may be stored for user access, but never forwarded to AI services.

====================================
MINDSTUDIO INTEGRATION
====================================

- MindStudio is accessed ONLY via the official Developer API v2
  or the official "mindstudio" NPM package.
- MindStudio calls MUST be server-side only.
- Never hardcode API keys; always use environment variables.
- Inputs to MindStudio must be structured and deterministic.

====================================
CODE QUALITY
====================================

- Write clean, readable, production-grade code.
- Prefer explicit over implicit behavior.
- Avoid magic values and undocumented assumptions.
- All core flows must be implemented end-to-end (no TODO placeholders).

====================================
DEFAULT ASSUMPTIONS
====================================

Unless explicitly stated otherwise:
- Use Next.js App Router conventions
- Use Supabase for auth, database, and storage
- Use shadcn/ui + Tailwind + lucide-react
- Assume production readiness is required
